# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


dependecies ->
1. npm init
2. npm install/i --save-dev hardhat@latest   
3. npx hardhat init
4. npm install --save-dev chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation hardhat-chai-matchers

5. npx hardhat accounts
6. npx hardhat compile
7. npx hardhat test

8. npx hardhat run scripts/run.js 
    -> it is used to deploy out smart contract on local network
    -> local network was destroyed instantly

9. npx hardhat node -> starts local server which is working continously end.
